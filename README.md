Warning, this code is very experimental.

Build and serve a local version of the client folllowing these steps:

1. `npm install`.

2. `npm run build`.

3. `npm run start`.

Note, however, you should create your own Firebase project, and replace the Firebase configs throughout.

Also, the Firebase functions have some missing Todos, that need to be filled out.
